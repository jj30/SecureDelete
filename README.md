# SecureDelete
Allows you to obliterate a file by encrypting it into oblivion with a strong, random, unsaved password and AES 512 bit encryption.

In order to get a 512 bit key, you need to install the Java Cryptography Extension files at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html. Otherwise you get an 'illegal key size' exception.
